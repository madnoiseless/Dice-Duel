# Dice Duel: A Simple Dice Rolling Game

Dice Duel is a fun, interactive web-based game where two players roll dice and compete to see who gets the highest number. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the [Dice Duel website](https://madnoiseless.github.io/Dice-Duel/).
2. Click on the "Let's roll" button to start the game.
3. Each player will roll a dice, and the result will be displayed on the webpage.
4. The game will determine the winner based on the numbers rolled by both players. If one player gets a higher number, they win. If the numbers are the same, it's a draw.
5. Click on the "Let's roll" button again to play another round.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage and creating the layout.
- CSS: Used for styling the webpage, including fonts, colors, and overall design.
- JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity to the webpage, such as rolling the dice and determining the winner.

## Future Improvements
